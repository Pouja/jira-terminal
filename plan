plan:

jira issue start --- create new branch
jira search "jql" --- performs a search with the given jql syntax
jira issues STATUSSES --- opens all issues that are assigned to the current user and matches the given statusses
jira new PROJECT SUMMARY
    - DESCRIPTION
    --- Creates a new issue for the PROJECT and asks the user to give (optional) a description

next step:

let users define which columsn they want


TODO
    !implement one time config setup
    implement auto complete (will take a lot of effort and time)
    implement help
    !add one time oath -- this will probably be implemented later since oauth 1 (jira/attlasian do not support oauth 2, which is sad) is kinda unnecessary complicated.
